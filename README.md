In this project, we have built an IPL chatbot that uses Python and web scraping methods to gather data from many sources and provide users up-to-the-minute updates. The chatbot will be made to respond to user questions about the IPL, including those about results, fixtures, team standings, player statistics, and more. It will comprehend user inquiries using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deliver pertinent information in a conversational style. The information will be gathered from a variety of websites and APIs, including social media platforms, news websites, and official IPL websites. Without having to actively search the internet for information, the IPL chatbot will give fans a quick and handy method to remain up to date with the newest IPL events.
